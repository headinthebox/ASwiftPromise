This is a simple Promise library for Apple's Swift language.

** Currently this will NOT build due to a Swift unimplented feature **

If you try to compile currently (June 5th, 2014), you will get:
unimplemented IR generation feature non-fixed multi-payload enum layout

Hopefull this gets fixed soon!
